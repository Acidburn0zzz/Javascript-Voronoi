Main object: Voronoi
--------------------

A Javascript object which allows to compute a Voronoi diagram.
The Voronoi object doesn't render the resulting Voronoi diagram,
the user is responsible for rendering the diagram.


Usage
-----

Roughly:

  var voronoi = new Voronoi();
  var bbox = {xl:0,xr:800,yt:0,yb:600};
  voronoi.setSites([ /* an array of vertices */ ]);
  var diagram = voronoi.compute(bbox);

The returned 'diagram' variable is a Javascript object with the
following properties:

  diagram.sites:
    An array of unordered, unique Voronoi.Site objects underlying the
    Voronoi diagram.

  diagram.edges:
    An array of unordered, unique Voronoi.Edge objects making up the
    Voronoi diagram.

  diagram.cells:
    A dictionary of Voronoi.Cell objects making up the Voronoi diagram.
    The Voronoi.Cell objects in the dictionary are keyed on their
    associated Voronoi.Site's unique id.

  diagram.execTime:
    The time it took to compute the Voronoi diagram, in milliseconds.

Objects:

  Voronoi:
    The Voronoi object which computes a Voronoi diagram.

  Voronoi.Edge:
    id: a unique id identifying this Voronoi edge.
    lSite: the Voronoi.Site object at the left of this Voronoi.Edge object.
    rSite: the Voronoi.Site object at the right of this Voronoi.Edge object (can be null).
    va: the Voronoi.Vertex object defining the start point (relative to the Voronoi.Site
      on the left) of this Voronoi.Edge object.
    vb: the Voronoi.Vertex object defining the end point (relative to Voronoi.Site on
      the left) of this Voronoi.Edge object.

  Voronoi.Cells:
    A collection of Voronoi.Cell objects, keyed on the id of the
    associated Voronoi.Site object.
    numCells: the number of Voronoi.Cell objects in the collection.

  Voronoi.Cell:
    site: the Voronoi.Site object associated with the Voronoi cell.
    halfedges: an array of Voronoi.Halfedge objects, ordered counterclockwise, defining the
      polygon for this Voronoi cell.

  Voronoi.Halfedge:
    site: the Voronoi.Site object owning this Voronoi.Halfedge object.
    edge: a reference to the unique Voronoi.Edge object underlying this Voronoi.Halfedge object.
    getStartpoint(): a method returning a Voronoi.Vertex for the start point of this
      halfedge. Keep in mind halfedges are always countercockwise.
    getEndpoint(): a method returning a Voronoi.Vertex for the end point of this
      halfedge. Keep in mind halfedges are always countercockwise.

  Voronoi.Vertex:
    x: the x coordinate.
    y: the y coordinate.
    Really can be any object exhibiting 'x' and 'y' property
    members.
